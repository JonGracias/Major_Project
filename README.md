- &nbsp; Who are the users of the software?
  - &nbsp; Anybody that needs to compare the text of two documents, in either of picture or text file form.
  - &nbsp; A good application would be teachers checking for plagerism.
- &nbsp; What is the purpose of the software?
  - &nbsp; The software will highlight differnces in text documents.
  - &nbsp; It will create text files from pictures.
  - &nbsp; It will have spell checking.
- &nbsp; Where and when will the software be used?
  - &nbsp; The software will be anytime two files need to be compared.
  - &nbsp; The software will be integrated into mobil app and computer app offering file comparing at any time or place.
- &nbsp; How does the software work?
  - &nbsp; The software will use OCR Api for reading text from an image.
  - &nbsp; The program will use Swing for gui
  - &nbsp; The program will have a three panel interface. Two panels side to side where a user can drag and drop an image or file. 
  - &nbsp; The program will also offer to take a picture in which case it will launch the phone app (android only) where the user can take a picture of text.
  - &nbsp; The phone version of the app will have a character limit per comparison. The user will be able to iterate through sentences.
- &nbsp; Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
  - &nbsp; Currently there is not many apps that compare text on a file. I have mostly seen this in IDEs for code comparison.
  - &nbsp; This app will allow users to take photos for super fast comparisons.
